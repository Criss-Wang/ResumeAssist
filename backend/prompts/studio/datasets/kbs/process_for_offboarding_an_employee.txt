Offboarding Procedures at ComputeCore Systems
Effective offboarding is crucial for both departing employees and the organization. Here’s the process:
1. Notify HR:
The employee’s supervisor should inform HR of the upcoming departure as soon as possible.
2. Schedule an Exit Interview:
HR will arrange an exit interview to gather feedback and discuss final details, including benefits and final paychecks.
3. Return Company Property:
The departing employee must return all company property, including laptops, access cards, and other equipment.
4. Transfer Knowledge:
Encourage the employee to document their current projects and responsibilities to facilitate a smooth transition.
5. Final Pay and Benefits:
HR will provide information regarding the final paycheck and how benefits will be affected post-employment.
6. Update System Access:
IT will revoke access to company systems and accounts on the employee’s last working day.
