Subject: Performance Review Process at ComputeCore
Hi Rod,
At ComputeCore, we believe in continuous feedback and professional growth. Here’s how our performance review process works:
Annual Reviews: Conducted once a year, typically in December. You will meet with your manager to discuss achievements and set goals.
Mid-Year Check-Ins: Informal check-ins every six months are encouraged to provide ongoing feedback.
Goal Setting: You’ll work with your manager to set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals.
Professional Development Plans: Discuss any training needs during your reviews to ensure you have the resources for success.

Best,
Linda
