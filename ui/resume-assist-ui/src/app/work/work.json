It scans an AngularJS application for AngularJS patterns, provides statistics on your application, and identify the necessary steps for migrating to Angular. It highlights files containing AngularJS patterns and directs on how to convert those patterns to be Angular compatible. It is the first step in starting a your migration from AngularJS to Angular.",

So many businesses were going through the same experience and creating private internal documentation I saw duplicated across many teams, so a centralized place felt necessary."
