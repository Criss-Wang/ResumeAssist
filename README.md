## ðŸ“ˆ Roadmap
### Major updates
- This is a renewed effort of my instruction-based resume assist which started after my Master's Degree. I decided to overhaul the repo, and replace the simple llm-call with a more flexible, multi-agent AI assistant system.
### Completed
- Anthropic based LangChain engine
- Config-based Agent system
- Basic UI for Resume modification
- Neo4j connection
### In progress
- Unit Testing
- Linting
- Integration Tests
### Planned
- Ollama based LangChain engines (True unlimited use)
- Local Model (if GPU is available, may use quantized models)
